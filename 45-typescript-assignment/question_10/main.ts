Adding Comments: Choose two of the
programs you’ve written, and add 
at least one comment to each. If
you don’t have anything specific 
to write because your programs
are too simple at this point, just 
add your name and the current date at 
the top of each program file. Then write 
one sentence describing what the program does.
